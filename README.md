Stacking Ensemble Method: Developed a novel stacking ensemble method using XGBoost, SVM, and KNN for automatic classification of attacks and benign activity in EV charging stations, with feature extraction by KNN and SVM, and classification by XGBoost.
Feature Selection with PCA: Used PCA to identify key features related to attack detection, reducing resource complexity in the model.
Performance Comparison: Demonstrated superior performance by comparing the proposed stacking model with four diverse AI models.
